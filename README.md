# Babylon BTC Staking Indexer

## Overview

The **Babylon BTC Staking Indexer** is a core component of the 
Babylon blockchain’s staking architecture, responsible for syncing delegation 
and finality provider events from both the **Babylon blockchain (BBN)** and 
**Bitcoin (BTC)**. It processes, stores, and transforms on-chain events into 
API-friendly data structures, enabling the Babylon Staking API to efficiently 
serve staking-related data to the frontend.

### Key Responsibilities

- **Delegation Sync**: Syncs delegation and Babylon&BTC-related events, storing them in 
MongoDB for easy retrieval.
- **Finality Provider Sync**: Tracks and updates the state of finality providers
 (FPs), including status changes, creation, and edits.
- **Global Parameters Sync**: Syncs global parameters necessary for the staking 
mechanism.
- **Event Replay (pending)**: Allows manual operations like event replays, triggered by 
the Admin Portal or CLI, to recover or adjust state after chain forks or re-orgs.

## Architecture

The Babylon Indexer interacts with the following components:

- **BBN (Babylon Blockchain)**: Receives delegation and finality provider events
 via Cosmos CometBFT `/block_results` (over gRPC for better performance), as well
 as websocket subscriptions for events.
- **BTC (Bitcoin)**: Syncs withdrawal transactions and other BTC-related events.
- **MongoDB**: Serves as the storage layer where delegation, global parameters 
and finality provider data are stored.
- **API Event Queue**: The indexer pushes API-related events into a queue 
(RabbitMQ), consumed by the Babylon API for frontend-facing operations.
- **Admin Portal/CLI**: Provides interfaces for triggering event replays and 
other manual interactions with the indexer.
- **Data Transformation Service (Optional)**: Transforms delegation data from 
the indexer into other formats to backfill or migrate data for API as needed.

## Synchronization Process

The workflow involves:

1. **Bootstrap Process**: The indexer starts by syncing all events from the 
last processed Babylon block height to the latest height. 
This is a continuous process until the indexer catches up with the most recent block.
2. **Real-time Sync**: After catching up, the indexer subscribes to 
real-time WebSocket events for ongoing synchronization.
3. **Raw Data Synchronization**: The indexer primarily handles the 
synchronization of:
   - **Delegation**: Storing and tracking delegation data.
   - **Finality Provider**: Monitoring state changes and updates for 
   finality providers.
   - **Global Parameters**: Syncing parameters relevant to staking, unbonding, 
   and slashing.

4. **RabbitMQ Messaging**: When a state change occurs in any delegation, 
the indexer emits a message into RabbitMQ. This allows the Babylon API to 
perform metadata and statistical calculations, such as total value locked (TVL) 
computations.
5. **Bitcoin Node Sync**: The indexer also syncs with the Bitcoin node to 
check if delegations are in a withdrawn state, ensuring accurate tracking of 
withdrawal transactions.

## Installation & Setup
